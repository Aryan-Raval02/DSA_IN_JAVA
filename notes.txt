[] Vector :
    Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can chnage in size.
    When vector is full it double itself.

[] In Built Sort Function :

    Bubble Sort. Selection Sort, Insertion Sort Which have 0(2^n) Complexity.
    Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort Which have 0(nLogn) Complexity.

[] Order Complexity :
    It is way to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases.
    it help you to estimate.
        Time Complexity :  How long an algorithm takes to run.
        Space Complexity:  How much memory the algorithm uses.

    | Big O Notation | Name              | Example                              |
    | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | O(1)           | Constant time     | Accessing an array element           |
    | O(log n)       | Logarithmic time  | Binary search                        |
    | O(n)           | Linear time       | Loop through an array                |
    | O(n log n)     | Linearithmic time | Merge sort, Quick sort (avg case)    |
    | O(n²)          | Quadratic time    | Nested loops (e.g., bubble sort)     |
    | O(2ⁿ)          | Exponential time  | Recursive Fibonacci                  |
    | O(n!)          | Factorial time    | Brute-force permutations (e.g., TSP) |

[] Experimental Analysis :
    Write the prpgram and analysis time to execute program is called Experimental Analysis.
